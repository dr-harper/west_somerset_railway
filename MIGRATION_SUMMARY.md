# Train-Centric Data Model Migration Summary

## Migration Complete ✅

Successfully migrated the West Somerset Railway app from a station-centric to a train-centric data model, preparing it for Firebase integration.

## What Changed

### 1. New Data Model (`src/types/models.ts`)
- **Primary entity**: Trains with complete journey information
- **Train object** includes:
  - Unique IDs and service identifiers
  - Complete stop list with arrival/departure times
  - Real-time status and location tracking
  - Service type and operator information
- **Station object** simplified as reference data
- **Departure boards** generated from train data

### 2. Firebase-Ready Service Layer (`src/services/trainService.ts`)
- Async/await patterns matching Firestore API
- Real-time listeners for live updates
- Query methods for trains and stations
- Journey planning capabilities
- Simulated real-time updates (30-second intervals)

### 3. Comprehensive Mock Data (`src/services/mockTrainData.ts`)
- 10 realistic train services based on actual WSR timetable
- Northbound (Bishops Lydeard → Minehead)
- Southbound (Minehead → Bishops Lydeard)
- Mix of Diesel, DMU, and Steam services
- Complete station data with facilities and coordinates

### 4. Updated Components
- **DepartureBoard**: Now uses train service for real-time data
- **StationSelector**: Works with new Station type
- **App.tsx**: Integrated with train service
- **NEW: ActiveTrains**: Shows currently running trains with live positions

## Benefits Achieved

### For Users
- Real-time train tracking capability
- See trains currently running and their positions
- More accurate departure information
- Journey planning ready (origin to destination)

### For Development
- **Firebase-ready**: Service layer mimics Firestore patterns
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more trains/services
- **Maintainable**: Single source of truth for train data
- **Real-time capable**: Built-in support for live updates

## How It Works

### Data Flow
1. Trains are the primary data source
2. Each train contains its complete journey
3. Station departures are derived from train data
4. Real-time simulation updates train positions

### Query Examples

```typescript
// Get all running trains
const activeTrains = await trainService.getActiveTrains();

// Get departures from a station
const board = await trainService.getDepartureBoard('MIN');

// Find journeys between stations
const journeys = await trainService.findJourneys('BL', 'MIN', '14:00');

// Subscribe to real-time updates
const unsubscribe = trainService.onTrainUpdate('2C01', (train) => {
  console.log('Train updated:', train.currentLocation);
});
```

## Next Steps for Firebase Integration

When you're ready to add Firebase:

1. **Install Firebase**
   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```

2. **Replace mock data loading** in `trainService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   // Instead of: this.loadMockData()
   // Use: Firestore collections
   ```

3. **Replace simulated updates** with Firestore listeners:
   ```typescript
   // Instead of: setInterval updates
   // Use: onSnapshot listeners
   ```

4. **Add authentication** for admin features

5. **Create Firestore collections**:
   - `trains/` - Train services
   - `stations/` - Station information
   - `realtime/` - Live positions
   - `schedules/` - Daily timetables

## Testing the New Features

1. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   cd app/wsr-railway-app
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **View departures**:
   - Select any station
   - See real-time departure board
   - Platform information included

3. **Track active trains**:
   - Import and use the `ActiveTrains` component
   - Shows trains currently running
   - Updates every 30 seconds

## File Structure

```

├── types/
│   └── models.ts              # New unified type definitions
├── services/
│   ├── trainService.ts        # Firebase-like service layer

│   ├── StationSelector/       # Updated for new model
│   └── TrainTracker/
│       └── ActiveTrains.tsx   # New component for live trains
```

## Key Decisions

1. **Train IDs**: Using railway headcodes (e.g., "2C01")
2. **Service IDs**: Unique identifiers for each service
3. **Time format**: "HH:mm" strings for compatibility
4. **Status tracking**: Separate status for train and individual stops
5. **Location tracking**: Can be "at station" or "between stations"

## Ready for Production

The app is now structured to easily integrate with:
- Firebase Firestore for data storage
- Firebase Auth for admin access
- Real-time GPS tracking systems
- Push notifications for delays
- Analytics and monitoring
