# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** West Somerset Railway Train Detection System  
**Author:** Michael  
**Date:** 2024-06-01  
**Version:** 1.0

## Objective

Develop an automated train detection system for the West Somerset Railway that enhances safety, improves scheduling accuracy, and provides real-time data to operators.

## Background

The West Somerset Railway currently relies on manual train detection methods which are prone to human error and delays. An automated system will leverage modern sensor technology and machine learning to provide reliable and timely train presence information.

## Features

| Feature ID | Feature Description                           | Priority | Notes                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| F1         | Real-time train detection using sensors       | High     | Use infrared and pressure sensors |
| F2         | Alert system for unexpected train presence    | High     | Notifications via SMS and app     |
| F3         | Data logging for train movements              | Medium   | Store data for 1 year             |
| F4         | Integration with existing scheduling software | Medium   | API-based integration             |
| F5         | User interface for monitoring and control     | Low      | Web-based dashboard               |

## User Stories

1. **As a railway operator,** I want to receive immediate alerts when a train enters a restricted area, so I can take prompt safety measures.  
2. **As a maintenance engineer,** I want access to historical train movement data, so I can analyze patterns and schedule maintenance effectively.  
3. **As a scheduler,** I want the system to integrate with our existing scheduling software, so train timings are updated automatically.

## Technical Requirements

- Sensors must detect trains within a 10-meter range with 99% accuracy.  
- System latency must not exceed 2 seconds for detection alerts.  
- Data storage must comply with data protection regulations.  
- System uptime must be 99.9% annually.

## Constraints

- Limited budget of $50,000 for initial deployment.  
- Installation must not disrupt current railway operations.  
- System must operate in outdoor conditions, including rain and fog.

## Success Metrics

| Metric             | Target         | Measurement Method      |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Detection Accuracy | ≥ 99%          | Sensor validation tests |
| Alert Latency      | ≤ 2 seconds    | System logs             |
| System Uptime      | ≥ 99.9%        | Monitoring reports      |
| User Satisfaction  | ≥ 90% positive | User surveys            |
